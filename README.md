# App-Store-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-
*App Store Data Analysis using SQL*

This project focuses on analyzing app ratings using SQL to gain insights into various factors that influence app ratings. The analysis was conducted on a dataset of apps from a diverse range of categories.
Project Findings

The following key findings were derived from the analysis:
1. Paid apps consistently had better ratings compared to free apps, indicating a positive correlation between app pricing and user perception of quality.
2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages tended to have higher ratings, suggesting that catering to a moderate range of language options positively impacts user satisfaction.
3. Finance and book apps generally received lower ratings, highlighting potential areas for improvement in these categories to enhance user satisfaction.
4. Apps with descriptions longer than 1000 characters exhibited better ratings, emphasizing the importance of providing detailed information to users.
5. It is recommended for new apps to aim for an average rating above 3.5 to ensure competitiveness and meet user expectations.
6. The games and entertainment categories were found to have high levels of competition, necessitating unique features and engaging experiences to stand out in the market.
